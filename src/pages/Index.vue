      <h2>The idea</h2>
      <p>All over the globe, people are standing up against the injustices of our system. We want to help these social, progressive, and green rebels by building a toolset specifically designed for grassroots movements.</p>
      <p>Several commercial campaigning tools already exists, but only political parties and other larger nonprofit organisations with big budgets are able to afford those. Smaller activist groups have to rely on for-profit platforms like Facebook to reach out to their community. And the open source alternatives out there require too much technical expertise to set up.</p>
      <p><strong>Rebel Tools is a free, simple to use and open source alternative.</strong> It's build by activists, for activists. It includes all the tools you need as organiser to build a strong movement.</p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>With Rebel Tools, organisers get access to powerful movement-building tools, without needing technical experise to set it all up. All the tools are optimised based on real world experiences from <a href="https://activisthandbook.org/about" title="Guides for activists and rebels">activists around the world</a>.</p>
      <p>And the best part: Rebel Tools gets better over time, because anyone can contribute to our open source project. We even provide trainings and guides for those who want to learn how to help us build these tools.</p>
