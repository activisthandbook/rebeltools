      <p>Rebel Tools is being developed by the people behind <a href="https://activisthandbook.org" title="Activist Handbook, manual for rebels">Activist Handbook</a>, the Wikipedia for rebels. While developing Activist Handbook, we realised we needed a toolset to grow our movement, engage existing members, host events, schedule events, etc. As we are on a tight budget (we are all volunteers and pay everything out of pocket), we didn't like using the commercially available services.</p>
      <p>So we are developing our own tools! Everything we do, is to help people organise for positive change. That is why we made these tools available for free. In addition, we share our code publicly, so that movements can adapt the platform to their own needs.</p>
