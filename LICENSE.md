# Is Rebel Tools open source?
Yes, Rebel Tools is open source. We share all our code publicly. You are free to modify and redistribute it in any way you like, as long as you give Rebel Rools attribution, do it for non-commercial purposes, and publish your work under the same license (read the full license for details).

According to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/faq#commercial), this Creative Commons license is not open source, because it does not allow commercial use. We think the contrary is true. Commercial usage is never really 'free' or 'open'. The only way to make profit is by taking away wealth from other people and exploiting our earth's resources. We are all part of this toxic system, but we believe the open source community can take the initiative to build alternatives.

# What do you mean with non-commmercial usage?
As long as you are not making any profit by using Rebel Tools, you are free to do with it what you want. Of course, you can still ask your users money to cover your costs (for example: bills for your web server, your wages, your rent). We do not want you to starve. We just prohibit you to use Rebel Tools for capitalist exploitation.
