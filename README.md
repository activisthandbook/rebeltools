Rebel Tools is the all-in-one toolset for progressive movements. To make it as easy as possible for new developers to contribute, we have added elaborate documentation throughout the project.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

### Start the app in development mode
To start a local development server, run this inside your project folder:

## Host your own instance
Everyone can use [rebel.tools](https://rebel.tools) for free. However, you can also decide to host your own (customised) version.
